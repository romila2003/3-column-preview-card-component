## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a new concept of css grid and utilised this concept into my project when the card is in desktop screen. Css grid was fun to use and will try to incorporate it more into future challenges.

Css Grid - code: 

```css

@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {
    .container {
        margin: 10em auto;
        grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
        max-width: 750px;
    }
}

```

### Continued development

For future developments, I should use more css grids into future projects. Also, I should begin learning the basics of javascript and implementing my knowledge into the challenges.
